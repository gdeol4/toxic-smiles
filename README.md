# Toxic SMILES small molecule classifer

![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/ts.png "App preview")

This project was built using RDKIT, Flask, Microsoft Azure, Docker, and Scikit-learn. The model was trained using the TOX21 dataset with about ~8000 molecules. An in-depth write up can be found [here](https://www.gurkamal.com/p53-gc.html) with details including correcting class-imbalance, different classifeirs used, performance metrics, and the theory behind the project.

The web app is now hosted on Render as the cost of Microsoft Azure is much higher. ### [The app can be found here!](https://toxic-smiles.onrender.com/)
